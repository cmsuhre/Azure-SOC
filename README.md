# 🔒Azure Cloud SOC Project: Honeynet and SIEM 🔒

## Introduction

In this project, I created a small honeynet in Azure. I sent log data from different sources to a Log Analytics Workspace. Microsoft Sentinel uses this infrastructure for attack maps, alerts, and incidents. 

I started by monitoring metrics in an unsecured environment for 24 hours. I then implemented security enhancements to strengthen the setup. Finally, I conducted another 24-hour metric evaluation. The report presents the outcomes below.

📄 <strong><u>Collected Logs included: </u></strong>

- SecurityEvent: Windows Event Logs<br>
- Syslog: Linux Event Logs<br>
- SecurityAlert: Log Analytics Alerts Triggered<br>
- SecurityIncident: Incidents created by Sentinel<br>
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL: Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet<br>

## Configured Honeynet Features

The honeynet in Azure had features to track and simulate real world cyber threats: 

- 💻 <b>Virtual Machines:</b> I set up two Windows VMs and one Linux VM. I designed one of the Windows VMs to simulate attacks. It tested our defenses and the honeynet setup across other VMs

- 📊 <b>Log Analytics Workspace:</b> I funneled all logs from the components here. This simplified collecting and analyzing data on malicious activities with KQL.

- 🔒 <b>Blob Storage, Key Vault, and Activity Log:</b> A simulated threat tested their security.

- 🆔 <b>Microsoft Entra ID, once Microsoft Active Directory:</b> faced simulated threats in Azure.

- 🚨 <b>Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM):</b> Turns malicious activity data into custom alerts. This helps with threat detection and incident response.

- 🌍 <b>Attack Maps, Incidents, & Alerts:</b> I added geolocation IP data to a custom watchlist. This tracked attack origins and improved monitoring in the Log Analytics Workspace.

<br><strong><u> 🔄 BEFORE & AFTER🔄 </u></strong><br>
<br> 
🔓 For the "BEFORE" metrics, we exposed all resources to the internet. The Virtual Machines kept their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls completely open. I deployed all other resources with public endpoints accessible from the Internet.

🔒 For the "AFTER" metrics, we blocked all traffic except from my admin workstation. I also secured all other resources with their built-in firewalls.

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The table below lists the metrics from our insecure environment over 24 hours:<br>
- Start Time: 2024-03-28 18:02:50
- Stop Time: 2024-03-29 18:02:50

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 47609
| Syslog                   | 3441
| SecurityAlert            | 4
| SecurityIncident         | 276
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 2300

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:<br>
Start Time 2024-03-30 15:44:43<br>
Stop Time	2024-03-31 15:44:43

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 12336
| Syslog                   | 5
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

After applying the security controls, there was a significant drop in the number of security events and incidents, clearly showing how effective these measures were. It's also important to point out that if the network resources had been in heavy use by regular users, we might have seen even more security events and alerts during the 24 hours after implementing the controls.
